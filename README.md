# gato
The async Python web framework that acts fast and lands on its feet.

Gato is an asynchronous Python web framework that models the Vibora framework, implementing Cython and other performance-enhancing technologies to significantly increase processing speed and efficiency.

## Goals
- Go quick
- Run clean
- Keep it simple

## Development Plan
Gato is going to be loosely derived from the design goals of the Vibora framework, and to execute this, we will port source from a legacy package of Vibora module-by-module, redesigning as we go.

## Let's build together.
The Vibora framework, while intelligently conceptualized and designed, lacked the community and structure that an open-source project needs to thrive. While a lot of brilliant engineers have created great open-source software mostly on their own, it's more meaningful and enriching for all involved when it becomes a community effort.

A major goal of this project is to cultivate an efficient and involved development/contribution pipeline, rather than an isolated and centralized dependent workflow for few.

This project is brand new and still in the planning phase. Join us on the [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/gatoproject/shared_invite/enQtNzA1NjcwMDU4MDA2LWIyZWFmNDY2YzEyM2RmYWQ2OWM3MzQyN2QwYzllYzg3OGRhMzJkOWIwMjA2OTEyOGVkYTliZTA4OWQwMDI1Y2U) to get involved in the decision-making process as we work through the details.
